The name of the script for the CS50p final project was supposed to be project.py. That file has been frozen to the last version, and from now on all updates will be made to a file named thpcal.py.

The project.py file does not need to be copied, and the main program will be thpcal.py from January 31, 2025. Also a database schema file is required: thp_db.sql.
